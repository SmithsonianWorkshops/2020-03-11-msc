  <h3>Required software</h3> 
  <p>For this workshop, we will be using R (the programming language) and RStudio 
    (special software to write R code). <strong>It is important that you have R and RStudio installed 
    on your computer prior to the start of the workshop.</strong> Installation instructions are available 
    here under the R and RStudio header: 
    <a href='https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html'>https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html</a>.
    Please follow the "If you donâ€™t have R and RStudio installed" section for your operating system. 
    We will take care of all other setup (downloading data, installing specific R packages) during 
    the workshop.</p>
  <p>You do not need to install spreadsheet software, OpenRefine, or SQL - we will not be covering 
    those programs in this workshop.</p>
  <p>This workshop will be conducted entirely in RStudio, so it is important that you have it 
    installed properly. <strong>If you encounter errors during installation, please contact us so we 
    can help you troubleshoot or provide you alternative solutions.</strong></p>
